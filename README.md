# Report on COVID-19 Open Data 


The aim of this research is to describe the COVID-19 Open Data dataset as Big data. Big data refers to large and complex datasets of enormous size that cannot be stored and processed by conventional resources. The data can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured. The four main characteristics of Big Data are Volume, velocity ,variety  and veracity which make it difficult to store, capture, manage and process using conventional resources. Big data can be found anywhere, anytime and in anyplace which makes it hard to manage and analyse using traditional applications. Such data can be collected from sensors, machines, humans and business processes. Similarly the COVID-19 Open Data is being generated globally through social media and online internet text documents, and  it continues to grow unabated.
